# Experimental Design

The diagnostic task is formulated as a multi-class classification problem involving five clinical categories: cognitively normal, significant subjective memory concern, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease.

A supervised learning framework is adopted with appropriate separation between training and evaluation data. Model performance is assessed using standard classification metrics suitable for clinical diagnostic studies.

Comparative evaluations are conducted across different feature group combinations to analyze the impact of clinical variables, drug usage, and protein biomarkers on diagnostic accuracy.
