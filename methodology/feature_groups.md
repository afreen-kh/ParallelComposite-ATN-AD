# Feature Groups

The feature space is organized into distinct groups to reflect the heterogeneous nature of Alzheimer’s disease–related data.

## Baseline Clinical Features
Demographic variables and neuropsychological assessment scores used as primary diagnostic indicators.

## Drug Usage Features
Binary indicators representing the usage of dementia-associated medications, including supplements, cardiovascular drugs, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and cognitive enhancers.

## Protein Biomarker Features
Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers following the AT(N) framework, including amyloid-beta (Aβ), total tau (Tau), and phosphorylated tau (pTau).

These feature groups are used independently and in combination to evaluate their individual and collective contributions to diagnostic performance.
